# Queen Koders Assignment One

## Task

- This is a simple project done as a team which involves creating ten different pages containing quotes and their images and linking one page to another.

## Description

- We collaborated on this project by:

 - Dividing the pages by the number of people in the group

 - Each member created a branch off of the main branch and worked on their part

 - Each member pushed to their branch

 - A member merged the branches together in the main branch

 - We adjusted the code to make sure everything worked fine.

 - And voila! We have a great project worked on by Queen Koders!!!
